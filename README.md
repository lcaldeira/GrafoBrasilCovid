# Covid-19 and Road Modes Graph

This dataset contains a graph with Brazilian municipalities as the vertices, existing road modes between them being edges and municipal data being the vertex attributes (features).

The main features are the Covid-19 pandemic daily numbers (case and death time series), but they also have demographic information, like territorial area, estimated population and number of hospital beds.
